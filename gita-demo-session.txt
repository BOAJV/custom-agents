# GITA AGENT DEMONSTRATION SESSION
# Date: November 25, 2025
# Branch: gita-test
# Purpose: Execute actual @gita commands from README and document results

=================================================================
EXECUTING ACTUAL @GITA COMMANDS FROM README
=================================================================

This session demonstrates running the exact commands documented in the README.md file.
Each command will be executed as if using the @gita agent in GitHub Copilot Chat.
=================================================================
COMMAND 1: Creating a new branch (simulating: @gita create new branch demo-branch and push)
=================================================================

Command: @gita create new branch demo-branch and push

Gita agent would execute:

Switched to a new branch 'demo-branch'

=================================================================
COMMAND 2: Push current changes (simulating: @gita push my changes)
=================================================================

Command: @gita push my changes

Gita agent workflow:
1. Branch discovery:
  custom-agent-test
* demo-branch
  gita-test
  main
  test-1
  testing-agent
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/custom-agent-test
  remotes/origin/gita-test
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/origin/test-1
  remotes/origin/testing-agent

2. Change detection:
On branch demo-branch
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   session.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	gita-demo-session.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

3. Git configuration setup:
git config --global core.editor nano
git config --global commit.verbose true

4. Staging changes:
git add gita-demo-session.txt

5. Commit with nano editor (would open nano for review):
git commit -e -m "Demonstrate @gita push my changes command

- Created demo-branch for gita agent demonstration
- Added gita-demo-session.txt with actual command examples
- Showing complete workflow: branch creation → staging → commit → push"

6. Push with upstream tracking (first time push):
git push -u origin demo-branch
remote: 
remote: Create a pull request for 'demo-branch' on GitHub by visiting:        
remote:      https://github.com/BOAJV/custom-agents/pull/new/demo-branch        
remote: 
To https://github.com/BOAJV/custom-agents
 * [new branch]      demo-branch -> demo-branch
branch 'demo-branch' set up to track 'origin/demo-branch'.

=================================================================
COMMAND 3: Commit and push to specific branch (@gita commit and push to main)
=================================================================

Command: @gita commit and push to main

Gita agent workflow:
1. Switch to main branch:
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
	gita-demo-session.txt
	session.txt
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
Aborting

   (Note: gita would handle uncommitted changes by staging them first)

2. Go back to demo branch to continue demonstration:
Already on 'demo-branch'
M	gita-demo-session.txt
M	session.txt
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/demo-branch'.

=================================================================
COMMAND 4: Save progress to current branch (@gita save my progress to this branch)
=================================================================

Command: @gita save my progress to this branch

Gita agent workflow:
1. Current branch status:
demo-branch

2. Stage all changes:
git add -A
